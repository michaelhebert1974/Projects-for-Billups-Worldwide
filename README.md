Michael Hebert's Projects for Billups Worldwide<br />
This project was created as part of a Coding Challenge for Billups Worldwide.<br />

Instructions for using the code provided in the Coding Challenge Project:<br />
(1) Make a 'pull' request from the repository:  michaelhebert1974/Projects-for-Billups-Worldwide<br />
    ... also can be found on the web at ...<br />
    https://github.com/michaelhebert1974/Projects-for-Billups-Worldwide<br />
    
(2) Copy and paste (or load) that code into either a web-editor or web-publishing application and run or launch it.<br /><br />


Game Instructions:<br />
(1) Click on any of the 5 colored buttons (beneath the Header section of the webpage) that are labeled:<br />
        "ROCK" | "PAPER" | "SCISSORS" | "SPOCK" | "LIZARD"<br />

(2) The button you select corresponds to the choice you would like to submit against the computer.<br />

(3) After you press 1 of the colored buttons, the computer will randomly select a choice from the same 5 options you have.<br />

(4) The results will be displayed for you in TEXT statements that let you know the outcome of each game.<br />
  
        There are 3 possible results: <br />

        (1) You won<br />
 
        (2) You lost<br />

        (3) You tied<br />
 
(5) There is also a scoreboard that keeps running totals based on the results.<br />

        The scoreboard displays the following info:<br />

        (1) The number of games you won<br />
        
        (2) The number of games the computer won<br />

        (3) The number of games both of you tied<br />

        (4) The total number of games played<br />

        (5) Your total winning percentage<br /> 
        Calculated as the total number of games you won divided by the total number of games you played.<br />
  
        PLEASE NOTE:  Ties do NOT count towards your "Win %"<br />
                      However - Ties do count towards you being UNDEFEATED against the computer.<br />

(6) You can reset all of your scores by pressing the "Reset All Scores" button in the Scoreboard section.<br />

(7) Play the game as many times in a row as you like.  Try to see how many games you can go undefeated!<br />

(8) If you need additional instructions about the logic of the wins, losses, and ties for each game, then please refer to the "Rules of the Game" section, which is located at the very bottom of the website.  There you will find a diagram and directions that help to explain the rules of the game. <br />

(9) Please contact the developer to provide feedback about your experience with the game.  <br />
